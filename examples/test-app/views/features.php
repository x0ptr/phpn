    <h2>Technical Highlights</h2>
    <p><strong>Architecture:</strong> PHPN uses a hybrid architecture that combines native UI components with web technologies. The native window manager handles OS integration while WebKit provides modern rendering capabilities.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Performance:</strong> By using WebKit instead of Chromium, PHPN applications are significantly smaller and use less memory than Electron apps while maintaining excellent performance.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Development Experience:</strong> Write your backend logic in PHP, style your UI with modern CSS frameworks, and add interactivity with JavaScript. It's the best of all worlds.</p>
