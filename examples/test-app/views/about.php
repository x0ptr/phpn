    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>PHPN (PHP Native) was created to fill a gap in the desktop application development ecosystem. While frameworks like Electron have made it easy to build desktop apps with JavaScript, PHP developers have been left without a similar solution.</p>
    
    <p>The project aims to bring the same ease of development that web developers enjoy to the desktop application world, but with the power and familiarity of PHP.</p>

    <h2>Why PHPN?</h2>
    <p>There are several reasons why you might choose PHPN for your next desktop application project:</p>
    
    <p><strong>Familiar Technology:</strong> If you're already a PHP developer, you can start building desktop apps immediately without learning Electron, Qt, or other desktop frameworks.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Lightweight:</strong> PHPN apps are smaller and use less memory than Electron applications because they use the system's native WebKit instead of bundling Chromium.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Native Integration:</strong> Direct access to native OS features through PHP extensions and the C bridge layer means your apps can do anything a native app can do.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Web Technologies:</strong> Use modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for your UI. Style with Tailwind, Bootstrap, or any CSS framework. Use Vue, React, or vanilla JS for interactivity.</p>
