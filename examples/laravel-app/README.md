## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd examples/laravel-app
   composer install
   ```

2. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

3. **Configure Database**
   - The app uses SQLite by default
   - Database file: `database/database.sqlite`
   ```bash
   touch database/database.sqlite
   ```

4. **Run Migrations**
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

5. **Seed Sample Data**
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```
   This creates:
   - 3 sample projects (Website Redesign, Mobile App, Marketing Campaign)
   - 15+ sample tasks with various statuses and priorities
   - 6 predefined tags

6. **Run with PHPN**
   ```bash
   ../../bin/phpn serve public/index.php
   ```

## Sample Data

The seeder creates realistic sample data:

**Projects:**
- üåê Website Redesign (Blue) - Web development tasks
- üì± Mobile App Development (Green) - Mobile app tasks  
- üì¢ Q1 Marketing Campaign (Orange) - Marketing activities

**Tags:**
- üêõ Bug (Red)
- ‚ú® Feature (Blue)
- üìù Documentation (Purple)

4. Use tags to filter and organize tasks

## Development Notes

### Key Files
- **Models**: `app/Models/{Project,Task,Tag}.php`
- **Controllers**: `app/Http/Controllers/{Dashboard,Project,Task,Tag}Controller.php`
- **Views**: `resources/views/{dashboard,projects,tasks,tags}/*.blade.php`
- **Routes**: `routes/web.php`
- **Migrations**: `database/migrations/2024_01_01_*.php`
- **Seeder**: `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php`

### Eloquent Relationships
```php
// Project has many Tasks
$project->tasks

// Task belongs to Project
$task->project

// Task has many Tags (many-to-many)
$task->tags

// Tag has many Tasks (many-to-many)
$tag->tasks
```

### Query Examples
```php
// Get overdue tasks
Task::overdue()->get()

// Get high priority tasks
Task::highPriority()->get()

// Get project with task counts
Project::withCount(['tasks', 'completedTasks'])->get()

// Tasks due today
Task::whereDate('due_date', today())->get()
```
